description: Set during King Philip's War, this novel takes place in the frontier
  community of Wish-Ton-Wish. After many years of war between the natives and the
  English settlers, a family is split between the two sides. The wept is a young girl,
  Ruth Heathcote, who, abducted by Native Americans, grows to marry their leader,
  Conanchet. Cooper contrasts the bloodthirsty piety of the Puritan preacher Meek
  Wolfe with the nobility of Conanchet.
